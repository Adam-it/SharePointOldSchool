# SharePointOldSchool

### What is this repo for
In this repo I gather many different project types or other solutions that may be used in SharePoint 2010/2013/2016
I treat this repo as a personal notes to which I get back to when I want to quickly start some project based on some example.
___
... BE AWARE - this repo is still under construction and I have a list of projects and solutions I want to cover in it, it's just a matter of time.
