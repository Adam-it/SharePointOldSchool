### What is this repo for

In this repo I gather many different project types or other solutions that may be used in SharePoint 2010/2013/2016
I treat this repo as personal notes to which I get back to when I want to quickly start some project based on some example.
This repo contains a perfect set of many farm and sandbox solutions (apps (add-ins) will be stored in different repo) that may be used to implement many different and powerful customizations of SharePoint and also extended SharePoint OOTB functionalities

### Notes

Projects were developed and tested on SharePoint 2016
