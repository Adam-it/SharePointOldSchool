## JSLinks

This project adds list with a field that has attached JsLink file to it. The list also has a content type that has an attached JsLink file. The JsLink files are deployed to Style Library in the site collection. The JsLink1 makes the filed readonly in edit form and in quick edit mode of the list (the new form is commented out). The second JsLink just produces a simple console.log to see that it is present when the item has the correct content type
